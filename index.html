          " [...] When I first heard that I was gonna be honoured with this reward, the very 
          first thing that I did was - I was speechless, briefly. I've presented this award before.
          I mean, I've watched in awe as Kay Yow and Eric LeGrand and all these other great people 
          have graced this stage. And although intellectually, I get it. I'm a public figure, I 
          have a public job, I'm battling cancer, hopefully I'm inspiring - at my gut level, I 
          really didn't think that I belonged with those great people. But I listened to what 
          Jim Valvano said 21 years ago. The most poignant seven words ever uttered in any speech 
          anywhere. "Don't give up, don't ever give up". Those great people didn't. Coach Valvano 
          didn't. So, to be honoured with this, I now have a responsibility to also not ever 
          give up. [...] I also realized something else recently. You heard me kinda allude to 
          it in the piece. I said 'I'm not losing. I'm still here, I'm fighting. I'm not losing.'' 
          But I've gotta amend that. When you die, that does not mean that you lose to cancer. 
          You beat cancer by how you live, why you live and in the manner in which you live. [...] 
          I just got out of the hospital this past Friday. Seven day stay. Man, I crashed. I 
          had liver complications. I had kidney failure. I had four surgeries in a span of seven 
          days. I had tubes and wires running in and out of every part of my body. Guys, when 
          I say every part of my body: every part of my body. As of Sunday, I didn't even know 
          if I'd make it here. I couldn't fight. But doctors and nurses could. The people that 
          I love and my friends and family - they could fight. My girlfriend, who slept on a very 
          uncomfortable hospital cot by my side every night, she could fight. The people that I 
          love did last week what they always do. They visited, they talked to me, they listened 
          to me, they sat silent sometimes, they loved me. And that's another one of the components 
          of the BeFoundation. This whole fight, this journey thing, is not a solo venture. This is 
          something that requires support. I called my big sister Susan a few days ago. Why? I 
          needed to cry. It was that simple. And I know that I can call her, I can call my other 
          sister Synthia, my brother Stephen, my mom and dad, and I can just cry. And those things 
          are very important. I have one more necessity. Eh, it's really two. Two very vibrant, 
          intelligent, beautiful young ladies. The best thing I have ever done, the best thing I 
          will ever do, is be a dad to Taelor and Sydni. It's true. I can't ever give up because 
          I can't leave my daughters. [...] But Taelor and Sydni, I love you guys more than I will 
          ever be able to express. You two are my heartbeat. I am standing on this stage here 
          tonight because of you. [...] I want to say thank you ESPN, thank you ESPYs, thank all of you. 
          Have a great rest of your night and have a great rest of your life."

            "In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a
            position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We
            thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth
            we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of
            junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are
            times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense
            of the <em>new</em>. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs
            friends. Last night, I experienced something new: an extraordinary meal from a
            singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged
            my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to
            my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous
            motto, 'Anyone can cook.'' But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he meant.
            Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist <em>can</em> come from <em>anywhere</em>.
            It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at
            Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in
            France. I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more."

            Black bodies swingin' in the Southern breeze /
            Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees /
            Pastoral scene of the gallant South /
            The bulgin' eyes and the twisted mouth /
            Scent of magnolias sweet and fresh /
            Then the sudden smell of burnin' flesh /
            Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck /
            For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck /
