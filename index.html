            As the age of technology moves onward, the resource pool available to
            those with an interest in learning only expands. Vast means to access countless
            new levels of information has provided us a sense of complacency - documentation
            curbs that complacency.

          "In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a 
          position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We 
          thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth 
          we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of 
          junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are 
          times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense 
          of the <em>new</em>. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs 
          friends. Last night, I experienced something new: an extraordinary meal from a 
          singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged 
          my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to 
          my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous 
          motto, 'Anyone can cook.'' But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he meant. 
          Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist <em>can</em> come from <em>anywhere</em>. 
          It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at 
          Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in 
          France. I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more."
